Docker improves CI/CD pipelines by providing consistent environments through containerized applications, ensuring code runs the same across development, testing, and production. Containers are lightweight and fast, reducing build and testing times. Docker simplifies deployments and rollbacks by using versioned images. It also enables easy scaling and better resource utilization, enhancing overall pipeline efficiency.
